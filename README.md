## üìñ Snippets

**All snippets start with `rb` for React-Bootstrap.**

There are 806 snippets available for components, imports, examples, and utility CSS classes. 

Read more on each below.

### Component Snippets

All React-Bootstrap's components are supported.

For example, `rb:alert`, `rb:badge`, `rb:breadcrumb`, etc.

Where applicable, suggestions are made for which components to use inside a given component, such as `thead` and `tbody` inside a `Table`.

### Import Snippets

Component import snippets are available for all React-Bootstrap components. 

All imports begin with `rb:import` followed by the component name. For example, `rb:import:row` will import `Row`. 

Since it's such a common use case, you can also use `rb:import:grid` to import `Container`, `Row`, and `Col` all at once.

#### Individual Import Snippets

[According to the docs](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/getting-started/introduction/#importing-components):

> You should import individual components like: `react-bootstrap/Button` rather than the entire library. Doing so pulls in only the specific components that you use, which can significantly reduce the amount of code you end up sending to the client.

All snippets for individual imports begin with `rb:import:only` followed by the component name. 

For example, `rb:import:only:button`, `rb:import:only:grid`, etc.

### Example Snippets

Where applicable, examples from the docs are provided as snippets. These can be very helpful as a starting point when working with more complex components, or for use as quick placeholders.

Example snippets all end with `-example`. 

For instance, `rb:alert-example` will insert an example `Alert` to build upon.

### Alert and Modal Functions

For convenience, function snippets are included for the show/hide functions needed for modals and dismissible alerts.

![Functions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/justinmahar/vscode-react-bootstrap-snippets/master/images/functions.gif)

Use `rb:modal-functions` for the following:

```tsx
const [showModal, setShowModal] = React.useState(false);
const handleCloseModal = () => setShowModal(false);
const handleShowModal = () => setShowModal(true);
```

And `rb:alert-dismissible-functions` for the following:

```tsx
const [showAlert, setShowAlert] = React.useState(false);
const handleCloseAlert = () => setShowAlert(false);
const handleShowAlert = () => setShowAlert(true);
```

These pair nicely with the snippets for `rb:modal` and `rb:alert-dismissible`.

### Table Utilities

This extension includes utilities for tables so you can quickly build table headers and table rows.

Use `rb:table-row-X` and `rb:table-header-row-X`, where `X` is the number of columns from 2-9, to quickly build rows in your `thead` and `tbody`.

### Bootstrap Utility CSS Class Snippets

Handy snippets are included for all [Bootstrap utility CSS classes](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/utilities/api/).

Use the `rb:utils` prefix to quickly look up and use any of Bootstrap's utility classes while building.
